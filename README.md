# RShiny---Best_Performing_Regression_Model

This project focuses on the comparative analysis of over 30 regression models using R's caret package to identify the optimal model for a dataset containing 969 observations with 21 variables. It emphasizes advanced preprocessing techniques, including handling missing data, scaling, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, to optimize model performance. Models were grouped into five primary categories: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Tree-Based, Neural Networks, Kernel-Based, and Ensemble methods, with additional exploration of transparent models for interpretability.

Key findings:

The monmlp neural network model emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the lowest RMSE and excelling in handling nonlinear relationships.
The robust linear regression (rlm) model was identified as the best transparent model, balancing performance and interpretability.
Various preprocessing strategies, including missing data imputation, outlier handling, and feature engineering, played a critical role in improving model accuracy and robustness.
This project highlights the importance of tailoring model selection and preprocessing strategies to the unique characteristics of a dataset, demonstrating the "no-free-lunch" theorem in machine learning.
